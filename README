This repository stores the source files for the solutions of the

This project was done as exercises of the authors, who are not
responsible for how you use it.

- Do your homework by yourself.
- The solutions might not be correct.
- The authors have no plan to write the solutions for the latest
 edition of the book, but they are happy to hear any feedback from
 the users, including the report of typos.
