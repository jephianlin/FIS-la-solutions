\section{Summary---Important Facts about Determinants}
\begin{enumerate}
\item With the help of Theorem 4.8 the statement in row version or column version is equivalent. So we won't mention it again and again.\begin{enumerate}
\item Yes. It's Exercise 4.3.8.
\item Yes.  However, the meaning of ``wise'' is hard to define.
\item Yes. See the Corollary after Theorem 4.4.
\item No. The determinant should be multiplied by $-1$.
\item No. The scalar cannot be zero.
\item Yes. Watch Theorem 4.6.
\item Yes. This is Exercise 4.2.23.
\item No. Read Theorem 4.8.
\item Yes. Peruse Theorem 4.7.
\item Yes. Glance the Corollary after Theorem 4.7.
\item Yes. Gaze the Corollary after Theorem 4.7.
\end{enumerate}
