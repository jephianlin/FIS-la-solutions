\chapter*{Prologue}
This is Solution to Linear Algebra written by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence. And this file is generated during the Linear Algebra courses in Fall 2010 and Spring 2011. I was a TA in these courses. Although this file will be uploaded to the course website for students, the main purpose to write the solution is to do some exercises and find some ideas about my master thesis, which is related to some topic in graph theory called the \textit{minimum rank problem}. 

Here are some important things for students and other users. The first is that there must be several typoes and errors in this file. I would be very glad if someone send me an email, \url{jephianlin@gmail.com}, and give me some comments or corrections. Second, for students, the answers here could not be the answer on any of your answer sheet of any test. The reason is the answers here are simplistic and have some error sometimes. So it will not be a good excuse that your answers is as same as answers here when your scores flied away and leave you alone.

The file is made by MikTex and Notepad++ while the graphs in this file is drawn by IPE. Some answers is mostly computed by wxMaxima and little computed by WolframAlpha. The English vocabulary is taught by Google Dictionary. I appreciate those persons who ever gave me a hand including people related to those mentioned softwares, those persons who buttressed me, and of course those instructors who ever taught me. 

Thanks.
